I am a solutions driven professional with over 8 years' experience creating effective strategies to improve information sharing and digital documentation for federal agencies, and NGOs. 

As a previous IT Specialist, I developed digital content for a readership that reached 294 US embassies, consulates and diplomatic missions. When it comes to creating and managing compelling content for the web, you need a professional that understands the dynamics of engaging diverse client needs. I possess a combination of knowledge and experience in data analysis, document management and web content management.

My dedication to social justice and public service extends to my work as an active volunteer for UNICEF, award-winning fundraiser for UN Women, and experience tutoring refugees in Egypt. I look forward to using my talents to support the work of local and international development agencies.
